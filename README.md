## How it works

PasswordLists are a collection of password dictionaries that use a transliteration approach. The repository presents sequences made up of words, surnames, names of the month and days of the week. There is also a simple script that allows you to build a transliterated list from an arbitrary list of words. 

Small dictionaries are for brute-forcing passwords on various resources, and large dictionaries are for brute-forcing hashes.
